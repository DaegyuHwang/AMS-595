% function fractal(), returns the number of iterations till divergence % c: complex value
% Considering a point that does not diverge in 100 iterations is in the set

%% Bisection Method
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% function fn(), returns a function that determines whether the point diverges or not along a vertical line at a given x
function fn = indicator_fn_at_x(x)
    fn = @(y) (fractal(x + 1i*y) < 100)*2 - 1; % setting 1 for divergence and -1 for no divergence
end



% function bisection(), returns a point where the point sign of f changes
% approximate the boundary of the fractal
function m = bisection(fn_f, s_y, e_y)

    y = linspace(s_y,e_y,10^3); % vertical vector of 100 points from s to e
    s_idx = 1; % lower bound point index, y
    e_idx = length(y); % upper bound point index, y
    while s_idx + 1 < e_idx
        m_idx = floor((s_idx+e_idx)/2); % get an integer mid value
        if fn_f(y(m_idx)) == 1
            e_idx = m_idx;
        else
            s_idx = m_idx;

% The Mandelbrot set is symmetric about the real axis (the x-axis). When searching for the upper boundary, you only need to search on one side (e.g., yâ‰¥0).
