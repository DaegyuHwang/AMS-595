### #Python Fundamentals: Assignment 1

This repository contains **Python** code within a Jupyter Notebook (`Py_Project_1_due_1019.ipynb`) that covers foundational programming concepts.

The project explores different approaches to fundamental problem-solving, including mastering data structures, efficient indexing, and implementing algorithmic logic.

The attached notebook is the primary file containing all assignment instructions and code challenges.

### #Core Concepts and Methodology

The core principle of this assignment is to establish a strong base in Python programming for future advanced topics like data science and deep learning. The algorithmic challenge, specifically generating **Pascal's Triangle**, is used to test proficiency in control flow and iterative design.

By successfully implementing these fundamental blocks, the student demonstrates readiness to handle more complex computational tasks.

### #Assignment Tasks

This project is divided into three main task areas, structured for comprehensive skill assessment.

#### Task 1: Data Types, Structures, and Indexing

- Demonstrates competency in handling basic Python data types (strings, integers, floats).

- Solves problems requiring the manipulation and indexing of complex structures like Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.

- Focuses on efficient data extraction and modification using advanced slicing techniques.

- Requires the use of Python's built-in methods for data handling.

#### Task 2: Algorithmic Implementation

- Requires the creation of a function to generate and return a specific row of **Pascal's Triangle**.

- The solution must use iterative methods (loops) to calculate coefficients based on the previous row's values, demonstrating the Law of Large Numbers (in terms of cumulative structure).

- Reports the final list of coefficients generated by the function.

- Focuses on the efficiency and clarity of the iterative algorithm.

#### Task 3: Coding Practices and Submission

- Encapsulates the solution logic into clearly defined and well-documented Python functions.

- Ensures adherence to principles of good coding practice (readability, commenting, style).

- Confirms the correct format and method for final submission via a GitHub repository.

### #How to Use

Open the `Py_Project_1_due_1019.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment (such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab).

To run the challenges, execute the code cells sequentially within the notebook environment.

Example: Run the cell containing the Pascal's Triangle function to test the output; `pascal_by_loops(n)`.

```python
# Example call from the notebook
result = pascal_by_loops(6)
