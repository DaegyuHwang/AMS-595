### #Python Fundamentals: Assignment 1

This repository contains **Python** code within a Jupyter Notebook (`Py_Project_1_due_1019.ipynb`) that covers foundational programming concepts.

The project focuses on mastering basic data types, complex data structures, efficient indexing, and implementing algorithmic solutions, serving as a critical step toward advanced topics like deep learning.

In the attached notebook, you can find the complete assignment instructions and required code implementations.

### #Core Concepts

The primary goal of this assignment is to demonstrate strong proficiency in essential Python mechanics and problem-solving. This includes utilizing built-in data types and applying loops and conditional logic to solve structured algorithmic challenges, such as generating **Pascal's Triangle**.

### #Assignment Tasks

This project is divided into multiple sections, designed to test core programming skills.

#### Task 1: Data Types, Structures, and Indexing

- Demonstrates proficiency with Python's basic data types (strings, integers, floats).

- Implements and manipulates complex data structures like Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.

- Solves problems requiring advanced slicing and indexing for data extraction and modification.

- Requires the use of standard Python functions and methods for basic data handling.

#### Task 2: Algorithmic Implementation (Pascal's Triangle)

- Requires the creation of a function to generate a specific row of **Pascal's Triangle**.

- The implementation must utilize iterative methods (`for` or `while` loops) without relying on built-in combinatorial functions.

- Focuses on generating the correct sequence of coefficients by summing adjacent elements from the previous row.

- Reports the resulting list of coefficients for the specified row.

#### Task 3: Coding Practices and Submission

- Ensures all submitted code adheres to principles of good coding practice (readability, comments, variable naming).

- Includes proper function definition and clear output.

- Focuses on the correct submission procedure, including uploading the notebook to GitHub.

### #How to Use

Open the `Py_Project_1_due_1019.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment (such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab).

To run the assignment, execute the cells sequentially, completing the code implementation in the designated sections.

Example: Run the cell containing the `pascal_by_loops()` function implementation to test the output:

```python
print(pascal_by_loops(6))
# Expected output: [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]
